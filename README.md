This repository contains basic exercises needed to pass for C projects on Piscine.
Code was developed at 42's Piscine, a 26-day (straight) C boot camp from 02/set/2024 to 27/set/2024.

HARD-SKILLS
C Language
The main programming language taught during the 42 Piscine is C. Students learn to work with variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, and the development of functions and programs, including creating and using libraries and Makefiles.

Shell
The first two days of the boot camp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate shell commands, which enable students to navigate the terminal efficiently.

Git
All projects are submitted through a remote Git repository, requiring students to be comfortable using this version control system.

SOFT-SKILLS
Self-learning and Proactivity
At 42, self-learning is central to its peer-to-peer education model. There are no teachers; instead, students rely on Internet research, collaboration with classmates, and hands-on experience to acquire knowledge, and learn at their own pace.
